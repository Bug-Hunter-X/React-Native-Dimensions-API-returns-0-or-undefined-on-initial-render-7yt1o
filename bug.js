This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, and the dimensions are not yet available when the component mounts.  This can happen if you try to access the dimensions synchronously before the layout has been calculated. For example:

```javascript
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';

const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');

const MyComponent = () => {
  console.log('Width:', width); // May be 0 or undefined
  console.log('Height:', height);
  return (
    <View/>
  );
};
```

This will often log `0` or `undefined` because `Dimensions.get('window')` might not have the updated values immediately.
